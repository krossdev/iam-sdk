# Kross IAM Client SDK

Client SDK to talk with Kross IAM server.

All of SDK was generated by
[OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator),
please take a look.

## Supported Language/Framework

Since OpenAPI Generator support many language/framework, test and maintenance
all of these language is a impossible task to us.
current we only support below language/framework(test and maintenance):

* typescript-fetch

If your language is not list above, don't worry, generate it and test it.

## Generate SDK Code

```
yarn generate -g GENERATOR -o OUTDIR
```

`GENERATOR` in above command is **generator** for your language
(see below *List all generators*) and `OUTDIR` is output directory.

for example to generate `typescript+fetch` SDK:

```
yarn generate -g typescript-fetch -o typescript-fetch
```

### List all generators

```
yarn generators
```

## Write code by yourself

Essentially, Kross IAM Server is just a `http(s)` server, provides `restful`-style
endpoint to external client access. so, if you don't like to use generated code,
for various reasons, you can write your own code.

## API Documention

API documention was auto generated, you can view it in `./doc` directory, or
https://iam.kross.work/api online.
